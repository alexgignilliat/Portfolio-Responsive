<!--Hey there! Thanks for checking out my code. Just wanted to say upfront that while I did my best to follow the guidelines, I did add some of my own style. That being said, one thing I noticed in the examples given is that the main content areas are offset to the left in larger viewports. I did my best to stick to that.-->

  <!--This next part was definitely a learning experience. I started off essentially doing all of my styling inline... not a great move lol. I've since converted almost all of my CSS to it's own respective external file, but there are still a few things that break when swapping over. Any inline CSS you see is what remains of an absolute mess. Live and learn!-->

            From a very young age, I've had a passion for technology and a flair for expressing
            myself artistically.
            When I wasn't assembling personal computers for the fun of it, I was teaching myself
            new instruments and
            learning my favorite songs by ear. So far, I've taught myself guitar, drums, bass
            and piano, and have
            performed at venues across the southeast. Naturally, I dove right into music
            production and audio
            engineering. Through learning the in's and out's of different digital audio
            workstations, I believe this
            is where I first developed a deep appreciation for beautiful interfaces and a
            seamless user experience.
            <hr>
            <br>During the advent of blockchain, I became absolutely obsessed with the idea
            of decentralized
            currency, as well as blockchain's implications regarding the tokenization of music,
            art, real estate,
            etc. Because of my love for assembling and optimizing computers, I began building
            mining rigs to
            contribute to and support various digital asset networks. Around that time, I became
            increasingly
            fascinated with the software that giant tech companies and startups alike were
            utilizing - and they all
            seemed to have the most interesting and dynamic websites. On a whim, I started
            teaching myself Python 2
            (honestly, I just thought it had a cool name so I went for it) and absolutely fell
            in love, just like I
            had with the hardware side of computers as a child.

            I'm currently attending the full-stack web development program at Georgia Tech to
            continue honing my
            skills - not just to become employer ready, but to be employer competitive. I'm
            ecstatic to continue
            learning and to leverage my technical experience and artistic nature into a
            fulfilling career as a fully
            fledged web developer!</p>
