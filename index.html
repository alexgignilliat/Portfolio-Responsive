    <!--This was definitely a learning experience and going forward, I will definitely be using an external stylesheet. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I haven't been able to both complete this assignment *and* convert all of my styling to an external CSS file. That is something I will be undertaking soon, simply to help clean up the HTML and make it more easily understandable-->

          </div>From a very young age, I've had a passion for technology and a flair for expressing
          myself artistically.
          When I wasn't assembling personal computers for the fun of it, I was teaching myself
          new instruments and
          learning my favorite songs by ear. So far, I've taught myself guitar, drums, bass
          and piano, and have
          performed at venues across the southeast. Naturally, I dove right into music
          production and audio
          engineering. Through learning the in's and out's of different digital audio
          workstations, I believe this
          is where I first developed a deep appreciation for beautiful interfaces and a
          seamless user experience.
          <br>
          <hr>During the advent of blockchain, I became absolutely obsessed with the idea
          of decentralized
          currency, as well as blockchain's implications regarding the tokenization of music,
          art, real estate,
          etc. Because of my love for assembling and optimizing computers, I began building
          mining rigs to
          contribute to and support various digital asset networks. Around that time, I became
          increasingly
          fascinated with the software that giant tech companies and startups alike were
          utilizing - and they all
          seemed to have the most interesting and dynamic websites. On a whim, I started
          teaching myself Python 2
          (honestly, I just thought it had a cool name so I went for it) and absolutely fell
          in love, just like I
          had with the hardware side of computers as a child.

          I'm currently attending the full-stack web development program at Georgia Tech to
          continue honing my
          skills - not just to become employer ready, but to be employer competitive. I'm
          ecstatic to continue
          learning and to leverage my technical experience and artistic nature into a
          fulfilling career as a fully
          fledged web developer!</p>
