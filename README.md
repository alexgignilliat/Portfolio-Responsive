# Responsive Portfolio

This is my responsive portfolio created using Bootstrap! This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I invisioned it.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and check it out! Or visit the deployed version at: [Portfolio on GitHub Pages](https://alexgignilliat.github.io/Portfolio-Responsive/)

## Features, Important Notes, etc

While I generally tried to replicate my previous portfolio, I took a lot more creative liberties this time around. The general aesthetic is much more in line with my personal tastes and style.

Some things I added to make the page pop include:

- Name in nav bar directs user to GitHub profile
- Fade in on page load
- On hover button effects
- On hover image opacity effects
- On hover "main content" glow effects
- On hover navbar glow effects
- Contact form submit button stretch effect
- etc etc etc. Check it out yourself to see!
