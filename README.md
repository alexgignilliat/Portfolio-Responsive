# Responsive Portfolio

This is my responsive portfolio created using Bootstrap! This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this knowing almost nothing about Bootstrap, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or visit the deployed version at: [Portfolio on GitHub Pages](https://alexgignilliat.github.io/Portfolio-Responsive/)

## Technologies Utilized

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4

## Features, Important Notes, etc

While I generally tried to replicate my previous portfolio, I took a lot more creative liberties this time around. The general aesthetic is much more in line with my personal tastes and style. Due to the guidelines given, I've offset the main content areas to match the examples. Would love to have them centered, or maybe put some media icons to my GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc to fill in the gap.

Some things I added to make the page pop include:

- Name in navbar directs user to GitHub profile
- Fade in on page load
- On hover button effects
- On hover image opacity effects
- On hover "main content" glow effects
- On hover navbar glow effects
- Contact form submit button stretch effect
- etc etc etc. Check it out yourself to see!

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
